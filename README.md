# The Dirty Burger

Greetings Earthlings. This is a game that Mr. Lahey and I made in college.
Even though the game did not function 100%, we did pass our class. This is
the attempt to revive it, clean it up, and hopefully make a couple dabloons.

Work is being tracked here: https://trello.com/b/3FCaWGms/onetwothree

Legend for Trello:

😌😐😩 are the difficulties of the tickets.

😌 - Easy, 1/2 Days Work. 1 point. 

😐 - Medium, 1 Days Work. 2 points.

😩 - Hard, 2+ Days Work. 3 points.

If something goes over 2 days, it should be broken into smaller tickets. This game is simple but in order to keep it simple, we need to do a lot of work :)

I currently am shooting for 5 points a week, and hopefully we can get Mr. Lahey's Xcode up and running (and learn how to git simulatenously lol).
